# Home Assistant SwissWeatherAPI Client

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This custom integration adds a weather entity with data gathered from the SwissWeatherAPI.
The usage of this API requires an API key which you can get by sending me an email (check my GitHub Profile).

This integration uses the new config flow of HomeAssistant and thus is configured by using the `Add Integration` button.
